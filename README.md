###### Problems I Have Encounter

One of the issue I have encountered is when I tried connecting with my ESP32 it was giving me connection issues, it just would not upload the sketch and I tried deleting the drivers replacing it with other drivers but no fix, I will still try to solve the issue but at the moment I cannot find a fix but will find one soon.
